---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Singleton Pattern 

: utilized the Singleton design pattern to ensure that a certain class maintains only one instance. By employing this pattern, the instance of the class is created once and accessible globally throughout the program, providing a singular access point to it.


2. Visualization

: Users can easily add and delete items through a user-friendly interface by selecting specific items or item containers and clicking respective add/delete buttons. Additionally, they can visually inspect the layout of the farm as the system graphically represents its structure, enabling users to grasp it at a glance. Furthermore, users can monitor the real-time location and movement of drones, allowing them to track their status and take necessary actions.
